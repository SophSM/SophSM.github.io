## Bio

BSc. Genomic Sciences @ [UNAM](https://www.unam.mx/). I'm interested in bioinformatics and AI applications to study genomic data. I enjoy coding and I'm experienced with bioinformatic pipelines, from genome alignment to RNA-seq analysis, variant calling, database mining and GWAS analysis. I have studied the impact of the autoinmune response on the gene expression in lupus and I'm currently learning about deep-learning software to understant and predict genomic features.
