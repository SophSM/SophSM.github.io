## Bio

Genomic Scientist, bioinformatitian and data-enthusiast. I'm interested in the development, understanding and application of methods that leverage large genomic datasets with AI applications to study biological processes. I'm currently working as a data analyst at the Im Lab @ The University of Chicago, where I work on supplementing traditional TWAS frameworks with AI-generated genomic and epigenomic predictions for multiple applications.
